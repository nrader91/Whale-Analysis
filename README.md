# Whale-Analysis
The topic of discussion for this analysis will be algorithic trading strategies. Many investment managers have a love hate relationship with them and our job will be to show comparisons between algos and old school.

We are going to create a tool that shows perfomance from all portfolios comparing hedge funds with algorithims.  

There are 3 main tasks that will be accomplished.

1)Read & write in returns data for all portfolios. 
2)Show the success and outcome for each.
3)Create custom portfolio and provide similar analysis.
