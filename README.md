# Whale-Analysis
The topic of discussion for this analysis will be algorithic trading strategies. Many investment managers have a love hate relationship with them and our job will be to show comparisons between algos and old school.

We are going to create a tool that shows perfomance from all portfolios comparing hedge funds with algorithims.  

There are 3 main tasks that will be accomplished.

1)Read & write in returns data for all portfolios. 

2)Show the success and outcome for each.

3)Create custom portfolio and provide similar analysis.

# Conclusion
Analysis of all portfolios brought forth some interesting results.  The top performing portfolio turned out to be Algorithim 1.

Our created portfolio out performed the S&P 500 (SPy) but fell short to Algo 1 in certain areas.

Final Assesstment - To minimize risk and secure profit it would be best to use a combination of Algo 1, My Portfolio & SPY.
